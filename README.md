# Flappy-Bird using Genetic Algorithm

The project is an initiative to implement an Artificial Intelligence powered agent in order to play the game Flappy Bird with high yield. The Neural Network is trained using a Genetic Algorithm for learning which is inspired from the work of Charles Darwin, the survival of the fittest. The major issue with such a project is that the growth rate has been observed to be very slow initially in most naive approaches. However, by initialising the primary group of individuals using a concise mathematical model ensures a drastically reduced search space thus a remarkably higher initial growth rate can been achieved. This leads to an ascended rate of evolution thus yielding much better individuals.
